# Sentiment Analysis and Financial Ambiguity Detection
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing text data for sentiment and identifying potential ambiguities in financial terms. The provided code demonstrates a pipeline involving:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Removing symbols, converting text to lowercase, tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization.
- Feature Extraction: Utilizing TF-IDF vectorization to represent text data numerically.
Sentiment Classification: Training a Logistic Regression model to classify sentiment based on the extracted features.
- Financial Ambiguity Detection: Employing BERT embeddings and cosine similarity to identify potential ambiguities in financial terms within the text.

## Results and Findings
- Sentiment Analysis: The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 70% on the test set. This indicates the model's ability to effectively classify sentiment in the given dataset.
- Ambiguity Detection: The analysis identified no potential ambiguities in the text data. This is due to the limited number of words used for comparison to the text data which suggest ambiguity

## Potential Applications and Future Work
- Financial News Analysis: This approach can be applied to analyze financial news articles and identify potential misinterpretations or biases in reporting.
- Risk Assessment: Detecting ambiguities in financial documents can help assess potential risks associated with unclear or misleading language.
- Improved Sentiment Analysis: Incorporating ambiguity detection can enhance sentiment analysis models by considering the context of financial terms.
- Expansion of Financial Terms: The list of financial terms can be expanded to cover a wider range of concepts and domains.
- Fine-tuning BERT: Fine-tuning the BERT model on a domain-specific financial corpus can further improve the accuracy of ambiguity detection.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of combining traditional NLP techniques with advanced language models like BERT to gain deeper insights into financial text data. The findings highlight the importance of considering ambiguity in financial communication and the potential applications of this approach in various financial domains.
